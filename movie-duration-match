SQL
-----------
select a.flight_id, b.movie_id, b.duration
from flight_schedule as a
join entertainment_catalog as b
on a.flight_duration > b.duration
where a.flight_id = '101'
order by b.duration 


Pandas - used cross join to get all combinations and then took where flight_druation > film_duration
-----------
import pandas as pd

flight_101 = flight_schedule[flight_schedule["flight_id"] == 101]

merged = pd.merge(flight_101, entertainment_catalog, how = "cross" )

sol = merged[merged["flight_duration"] > merged["duration"]][['flight_id', 'movie_id', 'duration']]
sol



PySpark
------------
flight_101 = flight_schedule.filter("flight_id = '101'")
merged = flight_101.join(entertainment_catalog, flight_101.flight_duration > entertainment_catalog.duration)[["flight_id", "movie_id","duration"]].orderBy("duration")

merged.show()
